## Upgrading the Prusa mk3 and its influence on wall quality

I upgraded my Prusa mk3 R2 build with different axis and extruder. I printed different models before and after the upgrade to see how it affects the print quality. While I did also print all-in-one test, I wanted to focus on wall quality. Better known as 602 inconsitent extrusion.
